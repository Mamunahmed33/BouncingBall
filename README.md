# BouncingBall
BouncingBall is a simple PC game developed in java programming language using java swing. The concept of developing this game was taken from DX-Ball game. 

There are still some features need to develop in this game. IT was just the output of playing with java swing. I developed this game while I was a second year student and first introduced in java swing.
